## Inspiration
With rising rent costs, tenants often face challenges in resolving disputes and understanding their legal rights

## What It Does
Leverages a multi-agent group chat system to assist tenants in resolving conflicts and identifying valid cases against landlords. By streamlining communication and providing AI-driven insights, this app empowers tenants to take informed action.

## How we built it
We developed a multi-agent system using LangChain, integrating AI-powered roles that facilitate discussions and simulate a real courtroom in the form of a groupchat. Agents we built include a legal research assistant, an attorney that analyzes case details, and an assistant that analyzes compensation patterns and likely outcomes.

## Technologies Used

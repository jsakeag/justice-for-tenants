    "1. Inspire you to build\n",
    "2. Provide an introductory understanding of the main use cases of LangChain via [ELI5](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/eli5/#:~:text=ELI5%20is%20short%20for%20%E2%80%9CExplain,a%20complicated%20question%20or%20problem.) examples and code snippets.

    "### **What is LangChain?**\n",
    "> LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.\n",
    "*[Source](https://blog.langchain.dev/announcing-our-10m-seed-round-led-by-benchmark/#:~:text=LangChain%20is%20a%20framework%20for%20developing%20applications%20powered%20by%20language%20models)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**TLDR**: LangChain makes the complicated parts of working & building with AI models easier. It helps do this in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integration** - Bring external data, such as your files, other applications, and api data, to your LLMs\n",
    "2. **Agency** - Allow your LLMs to interact with its environment via decision making. Use LLMs to help decide which action to take next\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why LangChain?**\n",
    "1. **Components** - LangChain makes it easy to swap out abstractions and components necessary to work with language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Customized Chains** - LangChain provides out of the box support for using and customizing 'chains' - a series of actions strung together.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Speed üö¢** - This team ships insanely fast. You'll be up to date with the latest LLM features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Community üë•** - Wonderful [discord](https://discord.gg/6adMQxSpJS) and community support, meet ups, hackathons, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though LLMs can be straightforward (text-in, text-out) you'll quickly run into friction points that LangChain helps with once you develop more complicated applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Main Use Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Summarization** - Express the most important facts about a body of text or chat interaction\n",
    "* **Question and Answering Over Documents** - Use information held within documents to answer questions or query\n",
    "* **Extraction** - Pull structured data from a body of text or an user query\n",
    "* **Evaluation** - Understand the quality of output from your application\n",
    "* **Querying Tabular Data** - Pull data from databases or other tabular source\n",
    "* **Code Understanding** - Reason about and digest code\n",
    "* **Interacting with APIs** - Query APIs and interact with the outside world\n",
    "* **Chatbots** - A framework to have a back and forth interaction with a user combined with memory in a chat interface\n",
    "* **Agents** - Use LLMs to make decisions about what to do next. Enable these decisions with tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Want to see live examples of these use cases? Head over to the [LangChain Project Gallery](https://github.com/gkamradt/langchain-tutorials)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Authors Note:**\n",

    "* This cookbook will not cover all aspects of LangChain. It's contents have been curated to get you to building & impact as quick as possible. For more, please check out [LangChain Technical Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html)\n",
    "* This notebook assumes is that you've seen part 1 of this series [Fundamentals](https://github.com/gkamradt/langchain-tutorials/blob/main/LangChain%20Cookbook%20Part%201%20-%20Fundamentals.ipynb). This notebook is focused on what to do and how to apply those fundamentals.\n",
    "* You'll notice I repeat import statements throughout the notebook. My intention is to lean on the side of clarity and help you see the full code block in one spot. No need to go back and forth to see when we imported a package.\n",
    "* We use the default models throughout the notebook, at the time of writing they were davinci-003 and gpt-3.5-turbo. You would no doubt get better results with GPT4\n",

      "Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe comments are discussing the difference between shallow embeddings of token IDs and deep embeddings, which are sequences of hidden states.  The commenter cs702 suggests that deep embeddings are richer representations and imagines an API for \"GPT3 deep sequence embeddings\" that would return a sequence of hidden states for each generated token, allowing higher-level models and apps to use this richer information. Another commenter, machiaweliczny, asks if this is not already what the OpenAI embeddings API provides. cs702 replies that the OpenAI embeddings API returns only a single vector per document, not the sequence of hidden states for each token.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Answer: The comments discuss the potential benefits of having access to deep embeddings (sequences of hidden states) for each token generated by LLMs like GPT-3, contrasting this with the current OpenAI embeddings API which provides a single vector per document.  The discussion centers around the idea that these deep embeddings would offer richer contextual information than current embedding methods.\n",

      "  \"primary_sources\": \"Petitioner Wilkerson's testimony about 35 years of tenancy, Ms. French's corroborating testimony, Ms. Andrade's (property manager) testimony, and the stated rent decrease from $824.51 to $282.95 in October 2023.\",\n",
      "  \"secondary_sources\": \"None provided in the prompt.  Further investigation would require accessing court records, property management records, and potentially city inspection reports.\",\n",
      "  \"expert_opinions\": \"The dramatic rent decrease in October 2023 is highly suspicious and warrants further investigation. This could indicate an attempt to circumvent rent control laws, a payoff to silence complaints, or other improper activity.  While no directly applicable legal precedent is provided in the prompt materials, this unusual financial activity demands scrutiny under the broader principles of fair housing and contract law.  For example, if the rent decrease is tied to a waiver of habitability rights, it could be deemed unconscionable.  Further, exploring any connection between the timing of the rent decrease and specific complaints made by the petitioners is crucial. The provided precedents lack direct relevance to this specific financial aspect, requiring research into case law related to disguised rent reductions, potential bribery, and undue influence in landlord-tenant relationships.\",\n",
      "  \"similar_cases\": \"The provided similar cases focus on broader housing issues, not this specific financial peculiarity. Research is necessary to find cases involving sudden, significant rent decreases in the context of tenant complaints.  Keywords for such research would include \\\"rent reduction,\\\" \\\"consideration,\\\" \\\"coercion,\\\" \\\"landlord-tenant,\\\" and \\\"habitability.\\\"  Examining cases involving challenges to rent control circumvention would also be pertinent.\",\n",
      "  \"statistical_data\": \"Data on average rent prices in the area and typical rent decrease patterns would be valuable.  Comparing the $282.95 rent to market value could reveal if it is unusually low, further supporting the suspicion of impropriety.  Additionally, data on the frequency of disputes and complaints in similar properties under the same management could provide context.  Finally, analyzing local rent control ordinances and their enforcement history will be essential to understanding the legal landscape surrounding this unusual rent reduction.\"\n",

    "Concerning matters that appear to be directly related to issues of habitability and reduction/failure to maintain or repair, the petition states that the elevator was out of service for six months, that the property is not kept clean, for example, mud and dirt from a creek overflow in 2023 was not cleaned up for several months, and that there is no on-site manager. The petition also identifies other problems, most of which as identified in the petition, have a start date in 2016.\n",

She did testify, however, about a water overflow in her kitchen sink in December 2023 that resulted in the discovery of a roach infestation and mold, that the elevator was out of service for six months, and that lights in the common area do not work. She expressed dissatisfaction with the overall lack of maintenance at the property.\n",
    "Ms. French also testified that the property was not maintained properly and that she feels Ms. Wilkerson is harassed. Mr. Wilkerson who has not lived on the property for many years largely testified about matters that were several years old.\n",
    "Ms. Andrade testified that Woodland Park had been responsive to the concerns of the Petitioners. For example, there is an on-site manager (herself), there is daily maintenance, and that many of the issues about which Ms. Wilkerson has concerns occurred many years ago. She acknowledged that the elevator was out of service for a period of time but estimated that it was out of service only a month and a half, and that the lights in the common area are being replaced. Ms. Andrade testified Woodland Park made repairs in Petitioners' kitchen following the water overflow and she is not aware of any ongoing issues with roaches or mold in the rental unit.\n",

This could shift the timeline of his responsibility for the uninhabitable conditions and associated damages.  Investigating this could involve: 1. Deposing Ms.   and other tenants to clarify their understanding of Sanchez\\'s role prior to January 2023.  Did they interact with Sanchez directly regarding maintenance issues? Did he present himself as having authority over the property? 2. Examining financial records. Were any payments for maintenance or repairs made by Sanchez, or through accounts he controlled, before January 2023?  3.  Obtaining communications (emails, texts, letters) between Sanchez and the former Landlord, and between Sanchez and  , to establish the nature of his involvement in property management during that period.  A pattern of directions or decisions from Sanchez could establish de facto control and thus earlier liability for the uninhabitable conditions.

    "### **What is LangChain?**\n",
    "> LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.\n",
    "*[Source](https://blog.langchain.dev/announcing-our-10m-seed-round-led-by-benchmark/#:~:text=LangChain%20is%20a%20framework%20for%20developing%20applications%20powered%20by%20language%20models)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**TLDR**: LangChain makes the complicated parts of working & building with AI models easier. It helps do this in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integration** - Bring external data, such as your files, other applications, and api data, to your LLMs\n",
    "2. **Agency** - Allow your LLMs to interact with its environment via decision making. Use LLMs to help decide which action to take next\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why LangChain?**\n",
    "1. **Components** - LangChain makes it easy to swap out abstractions and components necessary to work with language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Customized Chains** - LangChain provides out of the box support for using and customizing 'chains' - a series of actions strung together.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Speed üö¢** - This team ships insanely fast. You'll be up to date with the latest LLM features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Community üë•** - Wonderful [discord](https://discord.gg/6adMQxSpJS) and community support, meet ups, hackathons, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though LLMs can be straightforward (text-in, text-out) you'll quickly run into friction points that LangChain helps with once you develop more complicated applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Main Use Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Summarization** - Express the most important facts about a body of text or chat interaction\n",
    "* **Question and Answering Over Documents** - Use information held within documents to answer questions or query\n",
    "* **Extraction** - Pull structured data from a body of text or an user query\n",
    "* **Evaluation** - Understand the quality of output from your application\n",
    "* **Querying Tabular Data** - Pull data from databases or other tabular source\n",
    "* **Code Understanding** - Reason about and digest code\n",
    "* **Interacting with APIs** - Query APIs and interact with the outside world\n",
    "* **Chatbots** - A framework to have a back and forth interaction with a user combined with memory in a chat interface\n",
    "* **Agents** - Use LLMs to make decisions about what to do next. Enable these decisions with tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Want to see live examples of these use cases? Head over to the [LangChain Project Gallery](https://github.com/gkamradt/langchain-tutorials)\n",

    "* This cookbook will not cover all aspects of LangChain. It's contents have been curated to get you to building & impact as quick as possible. For more, please check out [LangChain Technical Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html)\n",
    "* This notebook assumes is that you've seen part 1 of this series [Fundamentals](https://github.com/gkamradt/langchain-tutorials/blob/main/LangChain%20Cookbook%20Part%201%20-%20Fundamentals.ipynb). This notebook is focused on what to do and how to apply those fundamentals.\n",
    "* You'll notice I repeat import statements throughout the notebook. My intention is to lean on the side of clarity and help you see the full code block in one spot. No need to go back and forth to see when we imported a package.\n",
    "* We use the default models throughout the notebook, at the time of writing they were davinci-003 and gpt-3.5-turbo. You would no doubt get better results with GPT4\n",

      "Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe comments are discussing the difference between shallow embeddings of token IDs and deep embeddings, which are sequences of hidden states.  The commenter cs702 suggests that deep embeddings are richer representations and imagines an API for \"GPT3 deep sequence embeddings\" that would return a sequence of hidden states for each generated token, allowing higher-level models and apps to use this richer information. Another commenter, machiaweliczny, asks if this is not already what the OpenAI embeddings API provides. cs702 replies that the OpenAI embeddings API returns only a single vector per document, not the sequence of hidden states for each token.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Answer: The comments discuss the potential benefits of having access to deep embeddings (sequences of hidden states) for each token generated by LLMs like GPT-3, contrasting this with the current OpenAI embeddings API which provides a single vector per document.  The discussion centers around the idea that these deep embeddings would offer richer contextual information than current embedding methods.\n",

WITNESSES \\nThe following persons, duly sworn, testified at the Hearing and presented the following \\ntestimony: \\nOralia Belem Zavala Vasquez \\nMs. Zavala has lived in the Affected Unit since 2007. It has four rooms:  a living room, kitchen, \\nbathroom and bedroom.  and her mother live there with her.  Prior to Mr. \\nSanchez becoming her Landlord, , Mr. Sanchez‚Äôs aunt (the ‚Äúformer \\nLandlord‚Äù), owned the Property. Ms. Zavala was informed in January 2022 that the former \\nLandlord had died in December 2021 and that her nephew was going to be the new owner of \\nthe Property.  \\nThere was no written lease when Ms. Zavala moved into the Affected Unit. She only signed a \\nwritten list of rules governing the Property. When Ms. Zavala moved in, the rent was $800.00.  \\nShe started paying $825.00 when  came to live with her in 2014,  and then $850.00 in \\n2017 when her mother moved in. Ms. Zavala is not challenging the rent increases from $800.00 \\nto $850.00. \\nMs. Zavala currently pays $900.00 per month in rent, and, as of the Hearing date, she was \\ncurrent on the rent through September 2023.1 While Ms. Zavala‚Äôs memory was foggy, it was \\nestablished that prior to April 2021, she had been paying $850.00 in rent. She was informed \\nverbally of a rent increase of $50.00 per month sometime in March 2021 by  (‚ÄúMr. \\n‚Äù), the former Landlord‚Äôs property manager.  In January 2023, Mr.  informed \\nMs. Zavala verbally that there would be a $300.00 rent increase in February 2023 and another \\n$300.00 rent increase in March 2023. Ms. Zavala has not paid the rent increases demanded in \\n2023.  \\nWhen the former Landlord was still alive, Ms. Zavala would either call her or go to her house to \\ntell her about items in the Affected Unit that needed repairs. The former Landlord would send \\nMr.  to fix things. During that time, Ms. Zavala‚Äôs boyfri end, , was also \\nsent to do repairs in the Affected Unit, as was Mr. Sanchez. While the former Landlord was alive, \\nMs. Zavala would also sometimes call Mr.  directly to tell him about problems with the \\nAffected Unit. She informed him directly about problems with the heater and the electricity. \\nAfter the former Landlord‚Äôs death, Ms. Zavala sent a letter to Mr. Sanchez by email and FedEx \\n(the ‚ÄúLetter‚Äù) informing him of the problems in the Affected Unit.   \\nMs. Zavala described mold on the walls and ceiling in the bedroom, living room, kitchen and \\nbathroom. She showed pictures of visible mold on walls in the living room adjacent to the \\n \\n1 Although it appears that Ms. Zavala submitted more check receipts than the actual payments she \\nmade, the evidence of payment for August 2023 was explained by Ms. Zavala as including a check that \\nwas rejected by Mr. Sanchez because it had his name wrong (check #126) and a check receipt for the \\nreplacement check (#127).'),\n",

The mold has been there since Ms. Zavala moved in to the Affected \\nUnit, and it worsens during the rainy season. Ms. Zavala informed the former Landlord of the \\nmold in 2010, and she had a relative paint over it.  Ms. Zavala informed Mr. Sanchez of the mold \\nin the Letter.  The mold gives Ms. Zavala headaches, so she removes it with bleach.  \\nThe carpet has been in the Affected Unit since Ms. Zavala moved in.  It has not been cleaned \\nsince then.  Ms. Zavala was going to clean it herself, but her neighbor told her that Mr. Sanchez \\ndoes not want anyone to clean the carpet because it will damage the wood flooring \\nunderneath. Ms. Zavala showed a photo of a long hole in the carpet which has been there for \\napproximately five years, and she stated that in addition to being in bad condition, the carpet \\ngives off a foul odor. Ms. Zavala informed Mr. Sanchez of the condition of the carpet in the \\nLetter. She said that it is embarrassing to have a smelly carpet when she has guests over.  \\nAs of sometime in 2016, only one electrical outlet in the entire Affected Unit was functioning. In \\norder to have electricity for the refrigerator, the stove and the lights in the kitchen and \\nbedroom, Ms. Zavala had to run extension cords throughout the Affected Unit.  She used very \\nlong extension cords in order to be able to place them around the baseboards so that no one \\nwould trip over them. The electrical problem existed for approximately eight years prior to \\nfinally being repaired on September 15, 2023.  Ms. Zavala had informed the previous Landlord \\nof the electrical issues, and she sent Mr.  several times to fix the problem, but it kept \\nrecurring. Ms. Zavala also informed Mr. Sanchez in the Letter. Ms. Zavala testified that at one \\npoint, Mr.  installed a fuse box in a neighbor‚Äôs yard and told Ms. Zavala to go there to \\nflip the switches whenever a fuse blew out.  The neighbor ended up calling the police on her \\nwhen she did that.  \\nMs. Zavala believes that the electrical problem caused issues with her freezer and refrigerator, \\nwhich started about eight years ago. One day while she was at work, the freezer stopped \\nworking, all the food inside it thawed, and it leaked water into the refrigerator. The former \\nLandlord repaired the freezer, but then the food in the refrigerator started freezing.  \\nIn addition to the temperature problems, there were parts inside the refrigerator that were \\nbroken, and the door was broken. She told her former Landlord about the refrigerator being \\ndilapidated and freezing and thawing erratically, but nothing was done.  She informed Mr. \\nSanchez about the problem in the Letter. The issues with the refrigerator caused her to have to \\nthrow away a lot of food over the years.  \\nThere were also problems with a leaking shower in the Affected Unit.

She said that, in addition to the humidity from the \\nhot water leak being very uncomfortable, the cold water leak is also annoying because she can \\nhear it dripping at night time. Ms. Zavala testified that when Mr. Sanchez worked on the hot \\nwater leak, it took about a week, and they had no hot water during that time, so they had to go \\nto the gym to take showers. \\nMs. Zavala had problems with the stove for about seven or eight years.  At first, one of the \\nburners was not working, and eventually three burners stopped working, so she had only one \\nburner to cook with.  Not having a functional stove was very stressful; for example, in order to \\nmake breakfast for , she would have to wake up an hour early because it took 45 \\nminutes to make something that with four functioning burners would have taken 15 minutes. \\nShe informed the former Landlord at the time that the first burner stopped working, and she \\nlater informed Mr. Sanchez of the nonfunctional stove in the Letter. A new stove was delivered \\non September 27, 2023.  The new stove was supposed to be delivered a week earlier than it \\nwas, and Ms. Zavala twice took time off from work to be able to be at the Affected Unit for the \\ndelivery, but it did not arrive when promised, and Mr. Sanchez did not notify her of the change \\nin delivery schedule.  \\nThe exhaust fan over the stove had also not worked for seven or eight years, and it was replaced \\nwhen Mr. Sanchez repaired the electrical problems on September 15, 2023.  \\nThe smoke detectors in the Affected Unit were never replaced by the former Landlord, and they \\nceased to function. Ms. Zavala does not recall how long the smoke detectors were broken; she \\nsaid that there had been an inspection a number of years ago where it was pointed out that \\nthey were not working, and they were never repaired or replaced. Mr. Sanchez replaced the \\nsmoke detectors the day before the second Multi-Family Housing (‚ÄúMFH‚Äù) Inspection in July \\n2023.2  However, Ms. Zavala said that the new smoke detectors do not seem to be working \\nproperly because the alarm sometimes goes off randomly in the middle of the night. The lack of \\nfunctioning smoke detectors made Ms. Zavala fearful because she thought that the stove was \\nleaking gas, and she feared that there would be a fire during the night which would go \\nundetected.  \\nMs. Zavala testified that there were rats in the common areas outside which did not get into the \\nAffected Unit, but which got into her car and chewed some cables so that the car would not \\nstart. It was parked in the parking area of the Property at the time.  The rats were present on \\nthe Property since Ms. Zavala moved in.

Ms. Zavala had informed her former Landlord that there were \\nintermittent power outages where the lights would go out in the kitchen and various other parts \\nof the Affected Unit. Because the kitchen lights did not work, she had to purchase a lamp. \\nThe heat has not worked from the time Ms. Zavala moved in. For the first few years that she \\nlived in the Affected Unit, she did not use the heat, so she did not really notice that it was not \\nworking.  However, after she had been living there about five years, it was cold in December, so \\nshe attempted to turn the heat on, but it would not work.  She told the former Landlord, who \\nsent Mr.  to fix it.  He said it could not be fixed, so the former Landlord bought a new \\nheater; however, Ms. Zavala could never manage to get it to turn on when she used the \\nthermostat to set the heat level.  Mr.  told her to use a match to light the pilot, but she \\ncould not get that to work, either. Mr. Sanchez told her that the heater was a problem that \\nPG&E had to resolve. PG&E sent a technician to the Affected Unit about two months prior to \\nthe Hearing, and they told her it was an issue that should be dealt with by the landlord. They \\nsaid that the heater has to be cleaned. Last winter was very cold, so Ms. Zavala bought two \\nspace heaters. Ms. Zavala did not show the report from PG&E to Mr. Sanchez.  \\nMs. Zavala never refused to let Mr. Sanchez in to make repairs to the Affected Unit. She just \\nwanted sufficient notice from Mr. Sanchez prior to entry. Sometimes he gave her prior written \\nnotice and other times he would verbally ask to enter, and she would agree. \\nMs. Zavala believes that Mr. Sanchez intentionally locked her cat into a storage locker about \\nthree months ago. She discovered it after the cat had been missing for three days.  \\nMs. Zavala described all the conditions in the Affected Unit as causing her stress.  It was \\nfrustrating during cold weather not to have a functioning heating system. It was frustrating not \\nbe able to cook on the stove, and she was also afraid because she smelled gas from the stove, \\nand the smoke detectors were not working. It was frustrating that she would tell the former \\nLandlord that there were problems, and they would not get fixed. And then on top of not being \\nresponsive for years, the Landlords (both former and current) wanted to raise the rent. When \\nshe challenged the rent increases, Mr. Sanchez told her that if she did not like it, she could go \\nlive somewhere else.  \\n \\nMs.  is Ms. Zavala‚Äôs mother.

Ms.  discussed the water and mold issues with Ms. Zavala, and \\nMs. Zavala talked to the former Landlord, who sent Mr.  to look at the problem.  Ms. \\n said that Mr.  ‚Äúfixed it up,‚Äù but by the next day, the c ondition had returned.  \\nWith respect to the carpet, Ms.  described it as very old and in bad condition.  In the \\nliving room, the carpet has a hole, and it smells bad. In the bedroom, it is also in visibly bad \\ncondition.  Ms.  said that they were told not to wash the carpet, so all they could do was \\nvacuum it, but that does not diminish the smell. Ms. Zavala informed the former Landlord about \\nthe condition of the carpet.  \\nWith respect to the shower leak, Mr. Sanchez repaired the hot water leak, but then the cold \\nwater started leaking.  Ms. Zavala was told that the problem was caused by the faucets being \\nvery old, and that they do not make that kind of faucet anymore. \\nWith respect to the stove, they were able to use only one burner.   Even then, that burner was \\nnot working properly because they could smell gas when they cooked. Ms. Zavala reached out \\nto the former Landlord and Mr.  about this issue.  \\nMs.  next testified as to the heat issue.  She said that it got very cold in the Affected Unit \\nin the winter, like ‚Äúliving in a freezer.‚Äù Mr.  told Ms. Zavala to turn on the thermostat, \\nbut she was never able to get it to work.  \\nMs.  stated that they suffered a lot because of the condition of the Affected Unit.  It was \\nvery cold during the winter, water was leaking into the walls, and the stove did not work.  \\n \\nMr.  has known Ms. Zavala for 15 years, and she is his girlfriend. He met Ms. Zavala \\nwhile he was working for the former Landlord doing maintenance work on the Property.  He \\nknew the former Landlord his entire life, and he worked for her frequently. He performed basic \\nmaintenance tasks, such as basic electrical repairs or making repairs in the shower, and \\nreplacing the floors in bathrooms and kitchens. He was not an employee of the former Landlord \\nas he had a full-time job, but he worked for her in his free time and on weekends. He stopped \\nworking for the former Landlord six years ago, when he started freelancing, and it was no longer \\ncost effective to continue working for her. Mr.  currently works in the construction \\nindustry and is familiar with maintenance and repairs. He does not live in the Affected Unit, but \\nhe is there four or five days during the week and on weekends.  \\nFrom his observation, it is difficult to live in the Affected Unit because there are a lot of issues, \\nlike mold, especially in the bathroom, and problems with the carpet and the stove.  He feels \\nthat the most basic services were not provided.  \\nSince Mr.  stopped working for the former Landlord, he has only repaired things in \\nthe Affected Unit with the owner‚Äôs approval. He worked on electrical items like replacing \\nswitches, but he said that the entire electrical system in the Affected Unit needed to be'),\n",

He also helped Ms. Zavala clean off the mold.  He \\nchecked the stove and told her it could not be repaired, that she needed a new stove. He found \\nthat the steam from the bathroom was affecting the lights.  He felt that everything he did was \\nsuperficial because the things that really needed to be done were systemic. Mr.  \\ntestified that he fixed the various problems in the Affected Unit because even though Ms. Zavala \\nwould tell the former Landlord about things that needed repairs, the former Landlord took too \\nlong to address the issues, and these were urgent issues that affected everyday life. He has \\nnever been present when anyone came to make repairs.  \\nMr.  stated that approximately three weeks prior to the Hearing date, Ms. Zavala \\nreported that the Landlord was starting to fix the electricity and the stove. Prior to that time, \\nshe would comment that she had sent letters requesting repairs, but no one ever came. Mr. \\n also stated that when he worked for the former Landlord, he told her about the \\ncondition of the Affected Unit, but she would instruct him to repair things superficially and that \\nshe would replace the items that needed replacing at a later date, but she never did.  \\nSergio Sanchez Morado \\nMr. Sanchez began his testimony with the question as to why Ms. Zavala waited until his aunt \\npassed away to complain about the condition of the Affected Unit. He has only owned the \\nProperty for about five months. All of the income from the Property was being put into a trust \\nuntil April 2023, so he had no income to perform repairs until then.  He acknowledged that \\nthere were problems with rental units on the entire Property, and said that he was fixing the \\nproblems. \\nMr. Sanchez stated that Ms. Zavala has not been letting him enter the Affected Unit to make \\nrepairs. Mr. Sanchez said that when he went to the Affected Unit at the request of his aunt to \\nrepair the water leak, which was about five years ago, Ms. Zavala was rude and offended him. \\nAfter that encounter, he did not want to go back, and he did not do so while his aunt was alive. \\nHe also said that when he knocked on Ms. Zavala‚Äôs door in order to replace the smoke detector, \\nshe told him that he would have to do it right away because she was going out, which he took \\nas offensive. Mr. Sanchez said that the MFH inspector told him that he is required to give 24 \\nhours‚Äô advance written notice when he wants to make repairs.  The MFH inspector told him that \\nhe would provide him with a form of notice to use, and he is waiting for that form.  \\nMr. Sanchez testified that when the MFH inspector was at the Affected Unit, he told Ms. Zavala \\nto call PG&E to address the problems with the heater, and Ms. Zavala told the inspector that she \\ndoes not use the heater.  Mr. Sanchez said that he called PG&E. He said that the MFH inspector \\ntold Ms. Zavala to give Mr. Sanchez the report from PG&E or else he would not know what was'),\n",

He thinks the rats were \\ncaused by the clutter in Ms. Zavala‚Äôs garage space. He initially put poison out to kill the rats, but \\nthe MFH inspector told him not to do that, but to use traps instead, so he placed traps, and \\nthere are no more rats.  \\nLast year, Mr. Sanchez paid a pest control service to fumigate all of the rental units on the \\nProperty, but Ms. Zavala did not want to have the Affected Unit sprayed.  \\nWith respect to Ms. Zavala‚Äôs cat, Mr. Sanchez said that he did not intentionally lock the cat in a \\nstorage locker.  He said that the cat probably entered through his storage area which is \\nconnected to the storage areas for the tenants.  \\nConcerning the stove, when he went into the Affected Unit to examine it, he concluded that Ms. \\nZavala needed a new stove. The stove that he purchased arrived late because the person he \\nbought it from was ill and could not deliver it as promised. He said that he left a note for Ms. \\nZavala that the stove would not be delivered as planned. The stove was delivered the following \\nweek.  \\nWith respect to the electrical outlets, the electrician told him that there were wires crossed in \\ntwo outlets, which caused all the problems. The electrician replaced all of the electrical outlets. \\nMr. Sanchez also had him install a new kitchen exhaust fan and new lights in the kitchen.  \\nMr. Sanchez said he believes it is his responsibility to maintain the Property because it \\nultimately is his property, and he needs to take care of it. He would like to be able to repair all of \\nthe problems on the Property all at once, but he does not have the money to do that.  \\nWith respect to the refrigerator, Mr. Sanchez said that he could see it was in bad shape and \\nneeded to be replaced.  He ordered new refrigerators for all of the rental units on the Property, \\nwhich are supposed to be delivered on October 19. \\nWith respect to the carpet, Mr. Sanchez said that it could not be washed because the water \\nwould damage the wood floors underneath.  \\nWith respect to the mold, he said that it was Ms. Zavala‚Äôs fault because she does not open the \\nwindows, so the humidity accumulates. \\nConcerning the rent increases, Mr. Sanchez told his tenants that the property taxes are very high \\nand that he could not afford to pay them as well as the utilities without raising the rent.  He \\nadmitted that the rent increases of $300.00 in February and $300.00 in March were not legal \\nbut said that he needed to impose the rent increases in order to pay for expenses for upkeep \\nand maintenance.  \\nMr. Sanchez said that he was trying his best to treat his tenants well. He said that there are \\npeople interested in buying the Property for the land, meaning that they would tear down the \\nrental units, and all of the tenants in the 10 rental units as well as Mr. Sanchez, who also lives on \\nthe Property, would be ‚Äúkicked out.‚Äù  Even with the rent increases imposed on the rental units,'),\n",

All of the other tenants agreed to the rent increase except Ms. \\nZavala. He said that reducing the rent would be out of the question because if he did that, he \\ncould not pay the property taxes.  \\nMr. Sanchez testified that his aunt passed away on December 11, 2021. She left the Property to \\nhim; however, there was a lawsuit challenging the will, and the judge ordered that all income \\nfrom the Property be kept in an escrow account pending the outcome of the dispute. The \\nperson in charge of managing the Property at that time was Mr. .  Thus, Mr. Sanchez \\ngave the Letter that Ms. Zavala sent him listing the issues with the Property to Mr. . Mr. \\nSanchez stated that he was awarded title to the Property in April 2023. At that time, he received \\nthe money that was in the escrow account. Mr. Sanchez does not have any documentary \\nevidence of exactly when title passed to him, and he said that Mr.  will not currently \\ntalk to him about the Property.  Between December 12, 2021 and April 2023, Mr. Sanchez had \\nconversations with Mr.  about the condition of the Property.  In fact, Mr.  \\nadvised Mr. Sanchez to sell the Property because it had so many issues. \\nMr. Sanchez stated that he did not see why he should be liable for issues that arose while his \\naunt was the owner of the Property. \\n \\nMs.  testified that whenever she needs repairs in her rental unit, Mr. Sanchez comes \\nand performs the repairs. She has been living at the Property for 20 years, and has never had \\nany problems with repairs. Prior to Mr. Sanchez becoming the owner of the Property, she never \\nhad any problem with things getting fixed.  Sometimes there would be a delay while they waited \\nfor a part. The faucets in the bathroom were repaired by Mr. Sanchez five years ago.  She had a \\nproblem with her refrigerator, and Mr. Sanchez lent her a small refrigerator while the repairs \\nwere pending. Ms.  has never been inside the Affected Unit.  \\n \\nMs.  submitted an affidavit  on October 1, 2023.  Ms.  stated that she is a tenant \\nat the Property.

FINDINGS OF FACT SUPPORTING THIS DECISION \\n1. Petitioner moved into the Affected Unit in 2007.  At that time, her landlord was  \\n (the ‚Äúformer Landlord‚Äù), who was Respondent‚Äôs aunt. The Affected Unit \\nconsists of four rooms:  a living room, bedroom, kitchen and bathroom.  It is on a \\nproperty with 10 other rental units (the ‚ÄúProperty‚Äù). \\n2. There is no written Lease governing the Affected Unit. \\n3. The Rent for the Affected Unit as of October 19, 2015 was $825.00 per month. \\nSometime in 2017, the Rent was increased to $850.00 per month.  Petitioner is not \\ncontesting that rent increase.  \\n4. Sometime in April 2021, Petitioner began paying a rent increase of $50.00, to $900.00 \\nper month.  The notice of increase was given verbally sometime in March 2021 by  \\n, whom Petitioner understood to be the property manager (‚ÄúMr. ‚Äù) .  \\n5. The former Landlord died on December 11, 2021, and Petitioner was informed in \\nJanuary 2022 that Respondent would be the new owner of the Property.  The will was \\ncontested, and the income from the Property was held in a trust until approximately \\nApril 2023.  \\n6. Mr.  served as property manager of the Property while the former Landlord \\nowned it, and he continued to do so until approximately April 2023.  \\n7. In January 2023, Mr.  notified Petitioner verbally that the rent would increase \\nby $300.00 per month, to $1,200.00 per month, effective February 1, 2023. Petitioner \\nrefused to pay this increase.  \\n8. Also in January 2023, Mr.  notified Petitioner verbally that the rent would \\nincrease by an additional $300.00 per month, to $1,500.00 per month, effective March \\n1, 2023. Petitioner refused to pay this increase.  \\n9. Evidence was presented of visible mold on the walls and ceilings of the Affected Unit. \\nThere was testimony that the mold increases when it rains. The former Landlord \\naddressed the mold by painting over it in 2010.  Petitioner notified Respondent about \\nthe mold in writing on May 5, 2023.  \\n10. The carpet was worn when Petitioner moved into the Affected Unit, and photos were \\npresented showing a sizeable hole in it. There was testimony that a bad odor emanates \\nfrom the carpet. Petitioner notified Respondent about the carpet in writing on May 5, \\n2023.'),\n",

Commencing sometime in 2016, there was only one functional electrical outlet in the \\nentire Affected Unit, forcing Petitioner to run extension cords throughout the Affected \\nUnit in order to power the appliances and the lamps she bought to use in place of \\nnonfunctioning overhead lighting.  Petitioner informed the prior Landlord of the issue, \\nand she sent Mr.  to repair the electrical problems, but he did not succeed in \\ndoing so. Petitioner sent notification in writing to Respondent on May 5, 2023. The \\nelectrical wiring was repaired on September 15, 2023. \\n12.  In approximately 2016, all but one of the stovetop burners ceased to function, and the \\nexhaust fan for the stove stopped working.  Petitioner notified the former Landlord and \\nMr.  verbally about the stove, but it was not repaired. Petitioner notified \\nRespondent of the problems in writing on May 5, 2023. The exhaust fan was replaced on \\nSeptember 9, 2023, and a new stove was installed on September 27, 2023.  \\n13.  The refrigerator has been in the Affected Unit since Petitioner moved in. It has been in a \\ndilapidated condition for approximately eight years, and it periodically freezes food, \\nwhich then has to be thrown away.  Petitioner verbally informed the prior landlord when \\nthe problem first began, but it was not repaired, and Petitioner informed the \\nRespondent in writing on May 5, 2023. \\n14. The smoke and carbon monoxide detectors in the Affected Unit did not work for an \\nundetermined number of years.  Petitioner notified Respondent of this issue in writing \\non May 5, 2023. They were replaced on or about July 11, 2023. They now go off \\nrandomly without any cause.  \\n15. The shower began leaking hot water approximately eight years ago and was repaired \\napproximately five years ago by Respondent, who helped his aunt with maintenance at \\nthe Property.  Thereafter, the shower began leaking cold water and continues to do so.   \\n16. A rat chewed cables inside Petitioner‚Äôs car engine on or around January 10, 2017 while \\nthe car was parked in a common area on the Property. Petitioner informed the former \\nLandlord verbally sometime in 2017, but she did not inform Respondent of the rat \\nproblem.  Respondent set traps for the rats on or about July 11, 2023.  \\n17. The overhead lights in the kitchen stopped working approximately eight years ago, and \\nPetitioner verbally notified the former Landlord at that time.  The former Landlord sent \\nMr.  to repair the lights, but he did not succeed in doing so.  The light s \\nremained nonfunctional until the electrical wiring was repaired on September 15, 2023.  \\n18. The heater has not worked since Petitioner moved into the Affected Unit.  Petitioner \\ninformed Mr.  at some point between 2012 and 2016, and he installed a new \\nheater three or four years ago, but the thermostat does not work, so Petitioner is not \\nable to turn the heater on.  Because it was so cold this past winter, Petitioner purchased \\ntwo space heaters.'),\n",

A Multi-Family Housing (‚ÄúMFH‚Äù) Program Inspection of the Property was performed on \\nMay 31, 2023, with follow-up inspections on July 12, 2023 and August 18, 2023.  In the \\nInspection Reports for each date of inspection, the inspector directs Respondent to \\nrepair a loose electrical outlet in the kitchen, to replace the kitchen vent exhaust hood,'),\n",

The July 12 Inspection Report and the May 31 Inspection \\nReport indicate that the Affected Unit has no functional smoke or carbon monoxide \\ndetectors and orders their replacement within 48 hours. The May 31 Inspection Report \\nstates that ‚Äú[t]here are obvious signs of a rat infestation in the rear building in the utility \\nroom, have a pest inspection and treat all buildings.‚Äù \\n20. On July 19, 2023, at the request of Respondent, PG&E conducted an inspection of the \\nrange, oven and heater in the Affected Unit, and produced a Service Report which stated \\nthat a new stove was needed and that the heating unit required cleaning and a new \\nthermostat. Petitioner did not provide the PG&E Service Report to Respondent. \\n21. Petitioner and Respondent have had a tense relationship in the past which has affected \\nbehavior by both parties towards each other. \\n22. There was no credible evidence that Respondent intentionally trapped Petitioner‚Äôs cat in \\na storage locker. \\n23. There was no credible evidence that Petitioner refused to allow Respondent entry to \\nmake repairs. Respondent admitted that he knew that he needed to give 24 hours \\nwritten notice prior to entering to make repairs but had not done so.  \\n24. In addition to having Mr.  and Respondent make repairs to the Affected Unit, \\nthe former Landlord also hired  to perform maintenance.  Mr.  \\ntestified that he spoke to the former Landlord about the significant repairs that were \\nneeded in the Affected Unit, but she told him to make only superficial repairs and that \\nshe would replace the items that needed replacing at a later date; however, she never \\ndid so.   \\n25. Respondent admitted that all of the rental units on the Property need repairs and stated \\nthat he does not have the funds to make all the needed repairs. He admitted that the \\nrent increases in 2023, which were imposed on all of the rental units on the Property, \\nwere unlawful, but that they were necessary in order for him to afford to maintain the \\nProperty and to pay the property taxes.  He said that he explained this to the Tenants, \\nand Petitioner was the only one who refused to pay the increases.  \\n26. Respondent stated that he has ordered new refrigerators for all of the rental units on the \\nProperty which will be delivered October 19.  He said that last year, he paid a pest \\ncontrol service to fumigate all of the rental units but that Petitioner refused to have her \\nunit sprayed. \\n27.

DISCUSSION \\nUnlawful Rent Increases \\nPursuant to CSFRA Section 1710(d), a Tenant may file a Petition for a downward rent adjustment \\nif the Tenant believes that a Landlord has demanded or retained rent in excess of the lawful \\namount set forth in the CSFRA. The Tenant bears the burden of proof by a preponderance of the \\nevidence.  See CSFRA Section 1711(h) and Regulations Ch. 5, Section (G)(2) and (3). \\nPetitioner has claimed that there were three unlawful rent increases, one in April 2021, one in \\nFebruary 2023, and one in March 2023.  \\nThe first rent increase at issue is the increase on or about April 1, 2021, from $850.00 to \\n$900.00, a total increase of 5.9 percent.3  \\nUnder Section 1706(a) of the CSFRA, a Landlord may not charge as rent an amount greater than \\nthe sum of the Base Rent and any lawful rent increases implemented pursuant to the CSFRA.  \\nThe Base Rent, as defined in Section 1702(b)(1), for tenancies commencing prior to October 19, \\n2015, is the rent in effect on October 19, 2015.  Pursuant to Sections 1706(b) and 1707(a), the \\nBase Rent may be increased only by the amount of the Annual General Adjustment (‚ÄúAGA‚Äù), \\nwhich is announced by the Rental Housing Committee each year. Once the initial Base Rent is \\nestablished, a Landlord may increase the rent by no more than the AGA every 12 months. \\nSection 1707(c) requires that notice of a rent increase be in writing, be given at least 30 days in \\nadvance, and comply with state law, which would include in particular California Civil Code \\nSection 827.   \\nThe April 2021 rent increase was unlawful for two reasons.  First, at 5.9 percent, it was above \\nthe amount of the lawful AGA, which for the time period of September 1, 2020 through August \\n31, 2021 was 2.9 percent.  Secondly, notice of the rent increase was verbal rather than in \\nwriting.  Thus, that rent increase was invalid, and the lawful Base Rent is $850.00. Any future \\nrent increase must start with the $850.00 Base Rent.  \\nAlthough Respondent was not the Landlord at the time of the initial unlawful rent increase in \\n2021, he still bears the responsibility for the unlawful rent increase.  Under CSFRA Section \\n1702(j), a Landlord is defined as ‚Äú[a]n owner, lessor, sublessor or any other person entitled to \\nreceive Rent for the use and occupancy of any Rental Unit, or [a]‚Ä¶ successor of any of the \\n \\n3 The rent for the Affected Unit was initially $800.00 and was increased to $825.00 in 2014 and to \\n$850.00 in 2017.  Petitioner is not challenging the rent increases from $800.00 to $850.00.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/nas/ucb/davidyang/legal-rent/petition-decisions/California_1556 2023.11.21 HODecision_Redacted.pdf', 'page': 19}, page_content='20 \\n \\nforegoing.‚Äù  Thus, the CSFRA imposes its provisions on successor landlords. As a successor of \\nthe former Landlord who imposed the unlawful rent increase, Respondent is liable for that \\nLandlord‚Äôs actions.  This conc lusion is supported by Baychester Shopping Ctr., Inc. v. San \\nFrancisco Residential Rent Stabilization & Arbitration Bd. , 165 Cal.App.4 th 1000, 1005-1006 \\n(2008), where the appellate court held that a successor landlord was liable for its \\npredecessor‚Äôs unlawful rent increases because the regulatory scheme of the San Francisco \\nrent ordinance imposed such liability through its definition of ‚Äúlandlord,‚Äù which included \\nsuccessor landlords. The court held that the successor landlord was not liable under a \\ncontractual relationship with the prior landlord, but instead the successor landlord‚Äôs liability \\narose by operation of law, i.e., from the oblig ation imposed by the San Francisco rent \\nordinance to demand only lawful rent increases.  The CSFRA imposes the same obligation \\nupon successor landlords , and thus Respondent is liable thereunder for unlawful rent \\nincreases even though he had no contractual relationship with the former Landlord .  \\nThe second and third rent increases at issue for the Affected Unit were the verbal rent increases \\neffective February 1, 2023 and March 1, 2023.  Each of those increases was for $300.00.  As of \\nFebruary 1, 2023, the lawful rent was $850.00, since the earlier rent increase to $900.00 in 2021 \\nwas unlawful.  An increase of $300.00 from a Base Rent of $850.00 is 35.3 percent.   \\nThe rent increase on February 1, 2023 was unlawful for three reasons.  First, at 35.3 percent, it \\nwell exceeded the amount of the lawful AGA, which from September 1, 2022 through August \\n31, 2023 was 5.0 percent.  Secondly, in calculating the rent increase, Landlord used $900.00 as \\nthe Base Rent, i.e., the starting point for making rent increases, when the lawful Base Rent was \\n$850.00. Thirdly, notice of the rent increase was verbal rather than in writing.  Thus, the \\nFebruary 1, 2023 rent increase was invalid, and Petitioner was within her rights under the \\nCSFRA not to pay it. \\nBecause the February 1, 2023 rent increase was invalid, all subsequent rent increases based on \\nthe unlawful rent would be invalid.  Thus, the March 1, 2023 rent increase of $300.00 was \\ninvalid, and Petitioner was also within her rights under the CSFRA not to pay that rent increase. \\nAdditionally, it should be noted that under CSFRA Section 1707(b), a landlord may not increase \\nthe rent more than once in a 12-month period.  Two rent increases, both a lofty amount above \\nthe lawful AGA, within a 12-month period represent an egregious violation of the CSFRA. \\nIndeed, Respondent even admitted that the rent increases in 2023 were unlawful under the \\nCSFRA. \\nThe Base Rent for the Affected Unit is rolled back to $850.00 per month.  Any future rent'),\n",

The question is \\nwhether Respondent‚Äôs non-compliance with the CSFRA as to the remaining Rental Units on the \\nProperty preclude him from implementing rent increases on the Affected Unit. Respondent \\nadmitted that in 2023, he increased all of the Tenants‚Äô rent by an amount well over the amount \\npermitted by the CSFRA.  \\nSection 1707(f) states unequivocally that ‚Äú[n]o Rent increase shall be effective if the Landlord \\n(1) has failed to substantially comply with all provisions of this Article and all rules and \\nregulations promulgated by the Committee.‚Äù CSFRA Regulations Ch.12, Section (B) specifically \\nstates that charging unlawful rents without refunding the unlawfully demanded amounts \\n‚Äúmeans a Landlord has not substantially complied with the CSFRA and, therefore, cannot raise \\nrents and/or file a petition for upward adjustment of rent.‚Äù  The evidence has shown that in \\naddition to charging unlawful rents to Petitioner, Responent has also charged unlawful rents to \\nthe remaining Tenants on the Property.  This means that Respondent has failed to substantially \\ncomply with the CSFRA and, therefore, he may not raise rents on the Affected Unit until the \\nunlawful rents imposed upon all of the other Tenants are refunded. \\nIt should be noted that while Landlords may not raise rents above the AGA simply because they \\nfeel that they need to, a Landlord may file a petition for an upward adjustment of rent above \\nthe amount allowed by the AGA in order to ensure a fair rate of return on their investment. \\n(See, CSFRA Section 1710(a)).

While Respondent finds himself in the unfortunate position of having inherited a Property \\nthat has by his admission been neglected for many years, nowhere in the CSFRA is a Landlord \\nexcused from maintaining their property because the uninhabitable conditions existed prior to \\ntheir acquisition of the property.  As discussed earlier, Section 1702(j) of the CSFRA defines a \\nLandlord as ‚Äúan owner, lessor, sublessor or any other person entitled to receive Rent for the use \\nand occupancy of any Rental Unit, or‚Ä¶successor of any of the foregoing.‚Äù  The CSFRA thus takes \\na broad scope in its definition of Landlord, which includes an owner as well as their successors.  \\nThe CSFRA is obviously designed to cover situations in which property changes hands, as in this \\ncase, and one cannot absolve oneself of responsibility under the CSFRA by claiming to be the \\nsuccessor of the former owner.  Section 1710(b)(2) provides very simply that a Tenant may bring \\na Petition thereunder for ‚Äúthe Landlord‚Äôs failure to maintain the Rental Unit in habitable \\ncondition.‚Äù  There is nothing in the plain language of the CSFRA that would absolve a Landlord \\nbecause the lack of habitability began prior to the Landlord‚Äôs acquisition of the Property.  \\nIndeed, this would run contrary to the purpose of the CSFRA, which is, among other things, to \\n‚Äúpromote healthy housing‚Äù (Section 1700).

Someone who inherits property would not necessarily have \\nknowledge of the condition of the property.  Thus, in this case, it is necessary to derive from the \\nfacts presented just how much Respondent knew about the condition of the Affected Unit and \\nwhen he had that knowledge.  \\nRespondent testified that it was his belief that he did not own the Property until April or May \\n2023 but that he had no documents to substantiate his claim.  The Hearing Officer takes judicial \\nnotice of the records of the Santa Clara County Assessor with respect to the transfer of the \\nProperty.  The Assessor‚Äôs website4  indicates that there was a change of trustee on December \\n11, 2021, which corresponds with Respondent‚Äôs testimony that his aunt, the former Landlord, \\ndied on that date. The website shows a second change in ownership, a conveyance by deed, on \\nJanuary 13, 2023.  It is reasonable to conclude that the title was conveyed to Respondent on \\nthat date, not in April or May 2023 as he testified.  Respondent also testified that Mr.  \\nmanaged the Property from December 11, 2021 through April 2023, implying that Respondent \\nwas not involved in the operations of the Property.  However, there were contradictions with \\nrespect to this testimony.  Respondent himself testified that he paid for pest treatment of the \\nProperty last year, meaning in 2022.  This indicates that he was involved in maintaining the \\nProperty well before April 2023.  Additionally, Respondent testified that he spoke to the Tenants \\nabout his rationale for the large rent increases in 2023, which indicates that he was the one who \\ndecided that the increases were necessary.  Notice of the increases was given in January 2023, \\nproving that Respondent was involved in the operations of the Property at that time.  \\nRespondent also testified that he discussed the condition of the Property with Mr.  \\nduring the period of December 12, 2021 through April 2023, and that Mr.  told him to \\nsell the Property rather than incur the costs to repair its many problems.

Respondent had notice of the \\nfollowing issues as early as January 2022:  mold, stove and fan, and lack of heat.  Respondent \\nhad notice as of May 5, 2023:  refrigerator, smoke detectors.  Respondent had notice as of May \\n31, 2023:  rats.  \\nIt should be noted that while Respondent had ample notice as to all of the habitability issues, \\nand he had written notice directly from Petitioner as of May 5, 2023, he did not address any of \\nthe issues until the MFH inspections occurred, and even then, it took three inspections‚Äîon \\nMay 31, July 12, and August 18, 2023--to motivate him to begin correcting the more significant \\nproblems.  The earliest corrections‚Äîreplacing the smoke detectors and laying traps for the rats-\\n- were completed on or about July 11, 2023, three other issues were addressed in September, \\nand, as of the Hearing date, there were still five outstanding issues‚Äîthe heat, the mold, the \\ncarpet, the plumbing, and the refrigerator. Also, the smoke detectors need an adjustment \\nbecause they go off at random without being triggered by anything.  \\nDamages for Habitability Claims \\nDamages for unsafe or unhealthy conditions are generally determined in one of two ways:  \\ncalculating the difference between the fair rental value of the Affected Unit if it had been as \\nwarranted and the fair rental value of the Affected Unit as it is currently with the existing \\nconditions, or by a percentage reduction in use, which would involve reducing Petitioner‚Äôs rental \\nobligation by a percentage corresponding to the relative reduction of use of the Affected Unit \\ncaused by the unsafe or unhealthy conditions.  (See, Green v. Superior Court, 10 Cal.3d 616, 638, \\n639 fn. 24 (1974).)  In this particular situation, there has been no expert testimony as to the fair \\nrental value with and without the habitability issues, making the fair rental value methodology \\ndifficult to apply.

The electrical problems affected the entire Affected Unit; all of the \\nappliances had to be plugged into extension cords which went to a single outlet, and that single \\noutlet also provided the power for the lamps that Petitioner used since the overhead lighting \\ndid not work.   Because of the seriousness of this condition and its widespread impact, a 45% \\nreduction in rent would be reasonable.  This represents a 10% reduction for each room, plus an \\nadditional 5% for the overall impact on the Affected Unit. With respect to the heat, also a \\nserious problem but which only arises during part of the year, a 25% reduction would be \\nappropriate.  This represents a 6.25% reduction per room, just compensation for the discomfort \\ncaused by lack of heat, the space heaters that Petitioner had to purchase, and the additional \\ncost of electricity used by the space heaters.  \\nUse of the kitchen in the Affected Unit was quite diminished since the stovetop did not work, \\nthe exhaust fan did not work, the refrigerator did not function as it was supposed to, the \\noverhead lights did not work, and there was a dangerous electrical condition which affected the \\nkitchen as well as the entire Affected Unit.  The fan was replaced on September 9, 2023, and the \\nstove was replaced on September 27, 2023, but the refrigerator had not been replaced as of the \\ndate of the Hearing. There are four rooms in the Affected Unit; thus the kitchen is one-quarter \\nof the space.  Since the kitchen was effectively non-functional, it should be worth a reduction of \\n25% of the total rent; however, since the electrical problems have already been factored into \\nthe damages calculation, it would be reasonable to reduce the rent by 15% of the total for loss \\nof use of the stove, exhaust fan and refrigerator.  This can be broken down to 8% for the stove, \\n1% for the fan, and 6% for the refrigerator.  \\nThe mold potentially creates a health condition and also is evidence of general dilapidation and \\nlack of maintenance, which is worth a 5% reduction in the total rent.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \\n1.  Respondent is liable for the unlawful rent increase imposed by the former Landlord in 2021 \\npursuant to CSFRA Sections 1706(a) and (b) and 1707(a) and (c) and Baychester, 165 \\nCal.App.4th 1000, 1005-1006. \\n2.  The two rent increases imposed by Respondent in February and March 2023 were unlawful \\nbecause they exceeded the AGA , constituted two rent increases in one twelve -month period, \\nand were delivered verbally . See, CSFRA Sections 1706(a)(b); 1707(a)(c).  Because Petitioner \\ndid not pay these rent increases, no damages are owed for this claim.  \\n3.  The 2021 rent increase must be invalidated and the Base Rent rolled back to $850.00, its \\nlevel prior to the unlawful increase , and damages must be awarded for the difference \\nbetween the rent paid and the unlawful rent demanded  pursuant to CSFRA Sections 1702(i) \\nand 1714(a).   \\n4.  Petitioner has met her burden of proof as to the habitability issues pursuant to CSFRA \\nSection 1710.  Respondent‚Äôs liability dates back to his acquisition of title to the Property  on \\nJanuary 13, 2023.  \\nIX.  DECISION \\n1. The Base Rent for the Affected Unit shall be rolled back to $850.00 per month. \\n2. Respondent shall pay to Petitioner the amount of $1,500.00 as damages for collection of \\nunlawful rent through September 2023.   \\n3. Respondent shall pay to Petitioner the amount of $6,717.06 as damages for failure to \\nmaintain habitable premises up to September 30, 2023.   \\n4. The total amount set forth in 2 and 3, above, $8,217.06, may be paid in the form of 11 \\nmonthly rent credits.  This means that for the period of December 1, 2023 through \\nSeptember 20, 2024, monthly rent shall be reduced by $747.00 to $103.00, and the \\nmonthly rent for October 2024 shall be reduced by $747.06 to $102.94. \\n5. For October 1 through 31, 2023, Respondent shall refund to Petitioner the difference \\nbetween the total amount paid by Petitioner to Respondent as Rent for that month and \\nthe lawful rent of $850.00. That refunded amount shall be credited to Petitioner‚Äôs \\nmonthly rental payments on or before November 1, 2024.   \\n6. For November 1 through 30, 2023, Respondent shall refund to Petitioner the difference \\nbetween the total amount paid by Petitioner to Respondent as Rent for that month and \\nthe lawful rent of $850.00.  That refunded amount shall be credited to Petitioner‚Äôs \\nmonthly rental payments on or before December 1, 2024.'),\n",

For December 1 through 31, 2023, Respondent shall refund to Petitioner the difference \\nbetween the total amount paid by Petitioner to Respondent as Rent for that month and \\nthe lawful rent of $850.00.  That refunded amount shall be credited to Petitioner‚Äôs \\nmonthly rental payments on or before January 1, 2025. \\n8. If he has not done so already, Respondent shall make the following repairs on or before \\n30 days from the date of this Decision:  perform repairs to the heating system so that it \\ncan be turned on by Petitioner and provides necessary heat to the Affected Unit; find \\nthe cause of the mold and remediate it; replace the carpet; repair the leaky plumbing; \\nreplace the refrigerator; determine why the smoke detector is malfunctioning and \\naddress that issue.  \\n9. Starting on October 1, 2023, damages for habitability issues still outstanding shall \\ncontinue to accrue as follows, pursuant to CSFRA Regulations, Ch. 2, Section F(2)(a): \\n A.  Until the heating system is repaired, Respondent shall credit to Petitioner each \\nmonth the amount of 25% of her monthly rent, or $212.50. \\n B.  Until the mold is remediated, Respondent shall credit to Petitioner each month the \\namount of 5% of her monthly rent, or $42.50. \\n C.  Until the carpet is replaced, Respondent shall credit to Petitioner each month the \\namount of 1% of her rent, or $8.50. \\n D.  Until the plumbing leak is repaired, Respondent shall credit to Petitioner each month \\nthe amount of 1% of her rent, or $8.50. \\n E.  Until the refrigerator is replaced, Respondent shall credit to Petitioner each month \\nthe amount of 6% of her rent, or $51.00. \\n F.

Should Respondent desire to pay any or all of the amounts ordered to be paid in this \\nDecision earlier than as prescribed herein, he may do so.  If any of the amounts directed \\nto be paid as rent credits are paid in full as a lump sum, then the rent credits \\ncorresponding to that particular amount shall cease and shall be considered paid in full.  \\n11. The credits and payments to Petitioner as set forth herein shall be enforceable as to any \\nsuccessor in interest or assignees of Respondent. \\n12. In the event that either Petitioner or Respondent terminates Petitioner‚Äôs tenancy prior \\nto application of the rent credits or delivery of the payments ordered by this Decision, \\nthe total amount then owed shall become due and payable to Petitioner immediately \\nand if said amount is not paid, Petitioner shall be entitled to a money judgment in the'),\n",

It should be noted \\nthat CSFRA Regulations Ch. 7, Section (B)(1) requires that a notice in substantially the \\nsame form as that promulgated by the Rental Housing Committee must be served on \\nTenants for all rent increases.  \\n14. In addition to abiding by the requirements of Paragraph 13, above, Respondent may not \\nissue a rent increase for the Affected Unit if Respondent is in violation of any of the \\nprovisions set forth in CSFRA Section 1707(f)(1)-(3) and CSFRA Regs. Ch. 12, Section (B), \\nwhich include, among other things, registering the Property annually with the Rent \\nStabilization Program (see CSFRA Regs. Ch. 11), refunding all unlawfully charged rents \\nfor all Tenants, and maintaining the Property in habitable condition according to state \\nlaw and the CSFRA, including making all repairs ordered hereunder or required by the \\nCity Building Department or other department of the City of Mountain View as a result \\nof Multi-Family Housing Program Inspections. Only when Respondent has complied with \\nall of the provisions of this paragraph and paragraph 13, above, may Respondent issue a \\nrent increase, provided that they do so in a manner consistent with the CSFRA and \\nCalifornia law.   \\n15. If a dispute arises as to whether any party has failed to comply with this Decision, any \\nparty may request a Compliance Hearing pursuant to CSFRA Regulations, Ch. 5, Section \\nJ(1).

      "  \"expert_opinions\": \"The drastic rent reduction from $824.51 to $282.95 in October 2023 is highly suspicious and warrants in-depth investigation. This magnitude of decrease suggests a potential undisclosed agreement, possibly related to foregoing repairs or suppressing complaints.  This could represent an attempt by the landlord to circumvent legal obligations regarding habitability. It also raises concerns about potential coercion or undue influence.  Alternatively, it may point to an unreported change in the unit or tenancy agreement (e.g., loss of amenities, change in occupancy).  This anomaly overshadows the individual complaints, potentially indicating a broader pattern of problematic management practices.  Legal research should focus on case law concerning illegal rent concessions,  retaliatory rent reductions related to tenant complaints (Green v. Superior Court, 10 Cal.3d 616 (1974) - if applicable in this jurisdiction - establishes a tenant's right to pursue legal action without retaliatory action by the landlord), and cases involving undisclosed agreements impacting tenancy terms.  Further investigation requires obtaining the lease agreements, rent payment history, and communication records between the landlord and tenants to ascertain the reason for the rent decrease.\",\n",

Research should focus on cases involving disguised agreements tied to rent changes, potentially disguised as preferential rent agreements if they exist in this jurisdiction.

Searching legal databases for cases involving \\u201crent reduction,\\u201d \\u201cundisclosed agreement,\\u201d \\u201chabitability,\\u201d and \\u201cretaliation\\u201d within the jurisdiction would be crucial.\",\n",

    "Concerning matters that appear to be directly related to issues of habitability and reduction/failure to maintain or repair, the petition states that the elevator was out of service for six months, that the property is not kept clean, for example, mud and dirt from a creek overflow in 2023 was not cleaned up for several months, and that there is no on-site manager. The petition also identifies other problems, most of which as identified in the petition, have a start date in 2016.\n",
    "At the hearing, Ms. Wilkerson's testimony tended to be about many items that first occurred many years ago, for example the removal of the swimming pool, storage units and the intercom system. She did testify, however, about a water overflow in her kitchen sink in December 2023 that resulted in the discovery of a roach infestation and mold, that the elevator was out of service for six months, and that lights in the common area do not work. She expressed dissatisfaction with the overall lack of maintenance at the property.\n",
    "Ms. French also testified that the property was not maintained properly and that she feels Ms. Wilkerson is harassed. Mr. Wilkerson who has not lived on the property for many years largely testified about matters that were several years old.\n",
    "Ms. Andrade testified that Woodland Park had been responsive to the concerns of the Petitioners. For example, there is an on-site manager (herself), there is daily maintenance, and that many of the issues about which Ms. Wilkerson has concerns occurred many years ago. She acknowledged that the elevator was out of service for a period of time but estimated that it was out of service only a month and a half, and that the lights in the common area are being replaced. Ms. Andrade testified Woodland Park made repairs in Petitioners' kitchen following the water overflow and she is not aware of any ongoing issues with roaches or mold in the rental unit.\n",

This could shift the timeline of his responsibility for the uninhabitable conditions and associated damages.  Investigating this could involve: 1. Deposing Ms.   and other tenants to clarify their understanding of Sanchez\\'s role prior to January 2023.  Did they interact with Sanchez directly regarding maintenance issues? Did he present himself as having authority over the property? 2. Examining financial records. Were any payments for maintenance or repairs made by Sanchez, or through accounts he controlled, before January 2023?  3.  Obtaining communications (emails, texts, letters) between Sanchez and the former Landlord, and between Sanchez and  , to establish the nature of his involvement in property management during that period.  A pattern of directions or decisions from Sanchez could establish de facto control and thus earlier liability for the uninhabitable conditions.
